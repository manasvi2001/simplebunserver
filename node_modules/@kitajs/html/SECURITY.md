## Security

Due to the nature of this project, security is a top priority. If you believe you have
found security issues like XSS attacks or similar, please report them to me
([`security@arthur.place`](mailto:security@arthur.place)) in a responsible manner. You
will receive a response from me as soon as possible.

If the issue is confirmed, I will release a patch as soon as possible depending on
complexity but historically within a few days.
